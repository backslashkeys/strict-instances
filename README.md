# @rbxts/strict-instances
A library for handling instances used between the server and client on Roblox.

Features:
- Typed RemoteEvents and RemoteFunctions that check types server side during run time. (This doesn't support tables, only types from CheckableTypes. Right now it only supports up to 4 arguments, so create an issue if more is needed.)
- Typed attributes

# Roadmap
Right now, I'm adding features as needed for my projects and will take feedback and suggestions.
